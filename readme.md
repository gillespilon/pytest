# pytest code and notes

These are my [notes](notes.md) and code for pytest quick start guide. My goal is to learn pytest and apply it to my [datasense](https://github.com/gillespilon/datasense) package initially and then to all of my code.

Code for the book is hosted at https://github.com/PacktPublishing/pytest-Quick-Start-Guide.
